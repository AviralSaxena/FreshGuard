# Security Cleanup - Completed

## What Was Done

1. **Updated `.gitignore`** to exclude sensitive configuration files:
   - `src/fg.API/appsettings.json`
   - `src/fg.API/appsettings.Development.json`
   - `appsettings.json`
   - `appsettings.Development.json`

2. **Created fresh Git history** - All previous commits containing secrets have been removed

3. **Cleaned `cleanup-secrets.sh`** - Removed hardcoded secrets from the script itself

4. **Created `ai-server/env.example`** - Template for environment variables

## CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### 1. Rotate ALL Exposed API Keys Immediately!

The following keys were exposed in your git history and **MUST** be rotated:

- ❌ **OpenAI API Key** - Generate a new key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- ❌ **Google API Key (Firebase)** - Regenerate in Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com)
 ❌ **Azure Computer Vision Key** - Regenerate in Azure Portal
- ❌ **Azure Cosmos DB Keys** - Regenerate in Azure Portal
- ❌ **Azure Storage Account Keys** - Regenerate in Azure Portal

**Important:** Even though we removed the secrets from git history, anyone who saw the previous push attempt may have captured these keys. You MUST regenerate all keys.

### 2. Set Up Your Local Configuration Files

Create these files locally (they are now in `.gitignore` and won't be committed):

#### For AI Server:
Create `ai-server/.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_new_openai_key_here
PORT=5000
```

#### For iOS:
Create `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist` based on `GoogleService-Info.plist.example`:
- Download a fresh config file from Firebase Console
- Place it in the `ios/` directory
- Never commit this file!

#### For API:
Create `src/fg.API/appsettings.json` based on `appsettings.example.json`:
- Add your new CosmosDB connection strings
- Add your new Azure Storage connection string
- Add your new Azure Vision API key

Create `src/fg.API/appsettings.Development.json`:
- Add development-specific configurations
- Use the same structure as `appsettings.json`

### 3. Update Other Team Members

If others are working on this repository:
1. Have them delete their local `.git` folder
2. Fresh clone from GitHub
3. Set up their own local configuration files with the NEW keys

## Files That Should NEVER Be Committed

- `src/fg.API/appsettings.json`
- `src/fg.API/appsettings.Development.json`
- `appsettings.json`
- `appsettings.Development.json`
- `ai-server/.env`
- `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- `android/app/google-services.json`
- Any file containing actual API keys or secrets

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. ✅ Always use environment variables for secrets
2. ✅ Keep `.example` files as templates
3. ✅ Double-check staged files before committing: `git status`
4. ✅ Use Azure Key Vault or similar for production secrets
5. ✅ Never commit files with actual API keys

## Summary

Your repository is now clean and can be pushed to GitHub. However, **you must rotate all exposed keys immediately** as they were visible in the previous git history.
